## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchasing behaviour to uncover spending patterns, frequency trends, and high-value buyer segments. The entire workflow — from data cleaning and preparation in Excel to interactive insight visualization in Power BI — is built to mirror real retail analytics practices and support revenue-focused decision making.

✅ Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel): Cleaned the raw customer purchase dataset by fixing missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing columns, and preparing a stable base for analysis.

✅ Interactive Visualization (Power BI): Built a dynamic dashboard showing customer segments, contribution patterns, frequency trends, and category-wise insights through slicers, KPIs, and drill-down charts.

✅ Insights & Recommendations: Summarized all findings into a clear, actionable format to highlight high-value customer groups, buying trends, and improvement opportunities for business decisions.
